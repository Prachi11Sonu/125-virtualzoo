        <h2>Explore the Wonders of Nature</h2>
        <p style="font-size:20px;">Welcome to our virtual zoo, where you can discover a diverse range of fascinating animals.</p>
        <p>When a species disappears, biologists say that the species has become extinct. By making room for new species, extinction helps drive the evolution of life. Over long periods of time, the number of species becoming extinct can remain fairly constant, meaning that an average number of species go extinct each year, century, or millennium. However, during the history of life on Earth, there have been periods of mass extinction, when large percentages of the planet’s species became extinct in a relatively short amount of time. These extinctions have had widely different causes.

            About 541 million years ago, a great expansion occurred in the diversity of multicellular organisms. Paleobiologists, scientists who study the fossils of plants and animals to learn how life evolved, call this event the Cambrian Explosion. Since the Cambrian Explosion, there have been five mass extinctions, each of which is named for the geological period in which it occurred, or for the periods that immediately preceded and followed it.
            
            The first mass extinction is called the Ordovician-Silurian Extinction. It occurred about 440 million years ago, at the end of the period that paleontologists and geologists call the Ordovician, and followed by the start of the Silurian period. In this extinction event, many small organisms of the sea became extinct. The next mass extinction is called Devonian extinction, occurring 365 million years ago during the Devonian period. This extinction also saw the end of numerous sea organisms.
            
            The largest extinction took place around 250 million years ago. Known as the Permian-Triassic extinction, or the Great Dying, this event saw the end of more than 90 percent of Earth’s species. Although life on Earth was nearly wiped out, the Great Dying made room for new organisms, including the first dinosaurs. About 210 million years ago, between the Triassic and Jurassic periods, came another mass extinction. By eliminating many large animals, this extinction event cleared the way for dinosaurs to flourish. Finally, about 65.5 million years ago, at the end of the Cretaceous period came the fifth mass extinction. This is the famous extinction event that brought the age of the dinosaurs to an end.
            
            In each of these cases, the mass extinction created niches or openings in the Earth’s ecosystems. Those niches allowed for new groups of organisms to thrive and diversify, which produced a range of new species. In the case of the Cretaceous extinction, the demise of the dinosaurs allowed mammals to thrive and grow larger.
            
            Scientists refer to the current time as the Anthropocene period, meaning the period of humanity. They warn that, because of human activities such as pollution, overfishing, and the cutting down of forests, the Earth might be on the verge of—or already in—a sixth mass extinction. If that is true, what new life would rise up to fill the niche that we currently occupy?

    <h2>Extinct Species</h2>
    <h3>The Spix Macaw</h3>
    <p>The Spix's Macaw, also known as the Little Blue Macaw, is a strikingly beautiful and critically endangered parrot species native to Brazil. Recognizable by its vibrant blue plumage and distinctive facial pattern, the Spix's Macaw was first discovered in the early 19th century in the arid caatinga region of northeastern Brazil.

        Historically, the Spix's Macaw inhabited the riparian forests along the Rio São Francisco, where it fed on seeds, fruits, and nuts, and nested in tree hollows. However, due to habitat loss from agriculture, logging, and urbanization, combined with illegal trapping for the pet trade, the wild population declined rapidly throughout the 20th century.
        
        By the 1980s, the Spix's Macaw was believed to be extinct in the wild, with only a few individuals remaining in captivity. Efforts to conserve the species intensified, leading to the establishment of breeding programs and initiatives to protect and restore its habitat.
        
        In 1990, the iconic character "Blu" from the animated film "Rio" was based on the Spix's Macaw, bringing attention to its plight and raising awareness about the importance of conservation. Despite these efforts, the Spix's Macaw remains one of the rarest birds in the world, with only a few dozen individuals known to exist in captivity.
        
        Ongoing conservation efforts aim to reintroduce the Spix's Macaw back into its native habitat through carefully managed release programs and habitat restoration projects. While the road to recovery is challenging, dedicated conservationists and organizations continue to work tirelessly to ensure the survival of this critically endangered species.</p>
    <h3 style="padding:0%;">Dinosaur</h3>
   
    <p>Dinosaurs, the magnificent creatures of prehistoric Earth, emerged during the Triassic period approximately 230 million years ago. They evolved from earlier archosaur reptiles and quickly diversified into a myriad of species, dominating terrestrial ecosystems for millions of years. During the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods, dinosaurs flourished and adapted to various environments, from lush forests to arid plains.

        These ancient reptiles displayed remarkable diversity in size, shape, and behavior. Some, like the massive sauropods, reached lengths of over 100 feet and weighed dozens of tons, while others, like the agile theropods, were swift and deadly predators. From the iconic Triceratops with its distinctive frill and horns to the towering Brachiosaurus browsing on treetops, dinosaurs occupied numerous ecological niches.
        
        The extinction event that occurred approximately 65 million years ago, at the end of the Cretaceous period, spelled the end for most dinosaurs. While the exact cause of this mass extinction remains debated, theories include asteroid impacts, volcanic eruptions, and climate change. Nevertheless, a small group of dinosaurs, now known as birds, survived and continue to thrive today as the only living descendants of this ancient lineage.
        
        Dinosaurs, with their fascinating history and incredible diversity, capture the imagination of scientists and enthusiasts alike, providing invaluable insights into the evolution and dynamics of life on Earth.

        <h3>Dodo</h3>
        <p>The dodo, a now-extinct flightless bird, was native to the island of Mauritius in the Indian Ocean. Standing about one meter tall and weighing around 10 to 17 kilograms, the dodo had a distinctive appearance, with a large beak, stout body, and short wings. Its name, "dodo," is believed to have originated from the Dutch word "dodaars," meaning "fat-arse" or "plump-a*," referring to its bulky build.

            First encountered by Dutch sailors in the late 16th century, the dodo's fate was sealed by human activities within a relatively short period. The arrival of sailors and settlers on Mauritius brought invasive species such as rats, pigs, and monkeys, which preyed on dodo eggs and competed for food and habitat. Additionally, hunting by humans for food and the destruction of forests further contributed to the bird's decline.
            
            By the mid-17th century, just decades after its discovery, the dodo had vanished from Mauritius, becoming one of the most famous examples of human-induced extinction. Despite the lack of detailed scientific studies during its existence, the dodo has captured the imagination of people worldwide and has become an emblem of extinction and conservation.
            
            Today, the dodo serves as a poignant reminder of the irreversible impact of human activities on fragile ecosystems and the urgent need for conservation efforts to protect endangered species from a similar fate. Though the dodo is gone, its legacy lives on, inspiring conservationists to safeguard Earth's biodiversity for future generations.</p>
        <h3>Golden Toad</h3>
        <p>The Golden Toad, also known as Incilius periglenes, was a brightly colored amphibian native to the cloud forests of Monteverde, Costa Rica. It was famous for its vibrant golden-orange skin, making it a striking symbol of the region's biodiversity.

            Discovered in 1966, the Golden Toad quickly gained attention due to its unique appearance and restricted range. However, its population began to decline dramatically in the late 1980s. Despite efforts to protect its habitat, including the establishment of the Monteverde Cloud Forest Reserve, the Golden Toad was declared extinct in 1989.
            
            The disappearance of the Golden Toad has been linked to several factors, including habitat destruction, climate change, and the spread of a deadly fungal disease called chytridiomycosis, which affects amphibians worldwide. Its extinction serves as a sobering reminder of the fragility of Earth's ecosystems and the urgent need for conservation measures to protect vulnerable species from disappearing forever.
            
            Although the Golden Toad is no longer found in the wild, it remains an emblematic species, representing the importance of preserving biodiversity and the delicate balance of nature. Scientists continue to study the causes of its extinction to inform conservation efforts aimed at preventing similar losses in the future.</p>
        <h3>Baiji</h3>
        <p>The Baiji, also known as the Yangtze River Dolphin or Chinese River Dolphin, was a freshwater dolphin species endemic to the Yangtze River in China. It was one of the rarest and most endangered cetaceans in the world, characterized by its long, slender body, distinctive beak, and rounded forehead.

            The Baiji's history is closely intertwined with the rapid industrialization and development along the Yangtze River. As China's population and economy grew, so did the threats to the Baiji's habitat, including pollution, habitat degradation, overfishing, and boat traffic. These factors led to a steep decline in the Baiji population throughout the 20th century.
            
            Despite conservation efforts and international attention focused on saving the species, the Baiji was declared functionally extinct in 2006 after an extensive search of its habitat failed to find any individuals. It was the first dolphin species to be driven to extinction primarily due to human activities since the modern era.
            
            The loss of the Baiji serves as a stark warning about the impacts of unsustainable development and habitat destruction on aquatic ecosystems and their inhabitants. Its extinction highlights the urgent need for conservation measures to protect other endangered species and preserve the biodiversity of our planet's rivers and oceans. Though the Baiji is gone, efforts continue to protect and restore its habitat and prevent similar tragedies from befalling other vulnerable species.</p>
<h3>Lysimachia minoricensis</h3>
<p>This herbaceous biennial or short-lived perennial species grows up to 25-80 cm in height. Its stem is upright, simple or branching from the base, with small glands in its upper parts. Its oval green leaves have almost no or a very short stalk, and are covered by whitish nerves on the upper side and are purple beneath, a feature shared by several other Balearic endemic plants. The small flowers are arranged in loose, terminal bunches with leafy bracts. The flowers are yellowish-green with a red-violet throat, and are 4 mm long (just a little longer than the calyx). The calyx is deeply divided with obtuse teeth. Flowering occurs from May to July and the fruits, 3.5-5 mm long, contain numerous black, 1 mm long, rough, laterally compressed seeds.
    This species has been categorized EW (Extinct in the Wild) according to the IUCN Red List Criteria. This means that the species is now only found in ex situ cultivation and in seed banks. Although the species has recently been re-introduced in the wild, up to now it has not been able to form self-sustaining populations. The reasons for its disappearance in the wild are unknown. It is possible that over-collection and the impact of human activities (such as fire and changes in agricultural practices) may have caused its extinction. On the other hand, the species might have benefited from agricultural activities practiced in the past, and the cessation of such practices could have caused the disappearance of its only suitable habitat. The most successful re-introduction attempts, during which plants survived for up to five years, have been carried out in areas previously disturbed by fire, cattle, goats or even used for habitat restoration purposes.
